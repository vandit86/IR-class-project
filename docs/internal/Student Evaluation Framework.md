# Student Evaluation Framework

---

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive evaluation framework for the Information Retrieval project. 
Each student's final grade will reflect both **individual contributions** and **team performance**, ensuring fairness and accountability across all teams.

Your final grade will be a composite of three key areas:
1.  **Overall Project Success (Team Grade):** How well did the final, integrated product perform?
2.  **Individual Contribution (Individual Grade):** What was the quality and quantity of your personal work?
3.  **Collaborative Performance (Peer-Assessed Grade):** How effectively did you work with your own team and other teams?

> **Our evaluation philosophy is simple:** A brilliant individual cannot succeed if the team fails, and a successful team cannot carry a member who does not contribute. This framework is designed to reward both individual excellence and collaborative synergy.

## 2. Grade Composition

Your final project grade will be calculated using the following weighted components:

| Component | Weight | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Part A: Overall Project Success** | 40% | A grade shared by all students, reflecting the quality of the final integrated product. |
| **Part B: Individual Technical Contribution** | 40% | An individual grade based on your direct contributions to the project's codebase and deliverables. |
| **Part C: Peer & Cross-Team Evaluation** | 20% | A score derived from anonymous feedback from your teammates and members of other teams. |

Please evaluate each component. Rate them on a scale of 1 to 5. Your feedback will be used to calculate a portion of the final grade. Please be honest and constructive.

### Rating Scale
*   **1 = Poor:** Did not meet expectations. Required constant follow-up.
*   **2 = Needs Improvement:** Met expectations inconsistently.
*   **3 = Met Expectations:** Was a reliable and solid, who completed assigned tasks.
*   **4 = Exceeded Expectations:** Was proactive, highly effective, and often helped others.
*   **5 = Outstanding:** Demonstrated leadership, took initiative, and consistently went above and beyond.

## 3. Detailed Evaluation Breakdown

### Part A: Overall Project Success (40%)

This portion of the grade assesses the collective achievement of all teams (Frontend, Backend, DevOps).

| Criteria | Weight | How It's Measured |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Final Project Functionality & Integration** | 20% | - Does the application run as a cohesive unit? <br>- Does the frontend correctly communicate with the backend API? <br>- Is the system properly containerized and deployable by the DevOps team? <br>- Are all core features implemented and functional? |
| **Meeting Project Milestones** | 10% | - Were sprint goals consistently met? <br>- Was required documentation (e.g., API specs, deployment guides) delivered on time and with sufficient quality? |
| **Final Project Presentation & Demo** | 10% | - Clarity and professionalism of the final presentation. <br>- Ability of the teams to demonstrate the live, working system. <br>- Depth of answers during the Q&A session. |

### Part B: Individual Technical Contribution (40%)

This component measures your personal hands-on contribution. **It is not about who writes the most lines of code.** We will focus on the *quality* and *impact* of your work.

| Criteria | Weight | How It's Measured |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **GitHub Contribution Analysis** | 25% | - **Commit Quality:** Meaningful, well-scoped commits with clear, descriptive messages. <br>- **Pull Request (PR) Quality:** Well-written PRs that clearly explain the "what" and "why." Includes responding to feedback and making revisions. <br>- **Code/Configuration Reviews:** Providing constructive, respectful, and helpful feedback on others' PRs. This is a critical sign of engagement. <br>- **Issue Management:** Creating clear, actionable issues/tickets and participating in technical discussions. |
| **Task Ownership & Completion** | 15% | - Taking ownership of tasks assigned to you in the project management tool (e.g., GitHub Projects, Trello). <br>- Consistent and timely completion of tasks. <br>- Proactively identifying and resolving bugs or blockers related to your work. |

### Part C: Peer & Cross-Team Evaluation (20%)

This component gives you a voice in the evaluation process and holds everyone accountable for their collaborative effort. All feedback will be submitted anonymously.

| Criteria | Weight | How It's Measured |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Intra-Team Peer Evaluation** | 10% | - You will rate each member of your own team on a 1-5 scale across several dimensions (e.g., Reliability, Communication, Contribution Quality, Proactiveness). <br>- Anonymized, qualitative feedback will be requested: *"What was this person's single biggest contribution?"* and *"What is one area they could improve in?"* |
| **Cross-Team Collaboration Evaluation** | 10% | - You will rate your interactions with the members of *other teams* you worked with directly. <br>- **Example:** A frontend developer might rate the backend developer who built the API endpoint they consumed. A backend developer would rate the DevOps member who helped them containerize their service. <br>- Dimensions will focus on **Responsiveness**, **Clarity of Communication**, and **Problem-Solving Effectiveness**. |

#### Professor & TA Observation
The instructional team will actively observe team dynamics during lab sessions, sprint reviews, and office hours. Proactive communication, effective problem-solving, and professional conduct will be noted and may be used to moderate final grades in exceptional cases.

### Evaluation for: 

*    **Reliability** Did they consistently complete their assigned tasks on time without needing reminders? 
*    **Contribution Quality**  Was their work (code, documentation, configuration) of high quality and well-executed? 
*    **Communication**  Did they communicate clearly, proactively, and respectfully in meetings and online channels? 
*    **Proactiveness & Problem-Solving** Did they take initiative to solve problems, suggest improvements, or help others when they were stuck?
*    **Collaborative Attitude**  Were they open to feedback, willing to compromise, and a positive influence on the team?

## 5. Final Grade Calculation Example

Your final grade is calculated as follows:

`Final Grade = (Part A Score * 0.40) + (Part B Score * 0.40) + (Part C Score * 0.20)`

> **Disclaimer:** The instructional team reserves the right to make final adjustments to individual grades in rare cases where there is overwhelming evidence of outstanding performance or a severe lack of contribution that is not accurately captured by this framework.

## Evaluation Tools & Resources

### GitHub Analytics
- **Repository insights**: Commit graphs, code frequency
- **Third-party tools**: GitStats, Gitinspector, or custom scripts
- **Manual review**: PR quality, code review comments

### Peer Evaluation Platform
- **Google Forms** / **Microsoft Forms** with anonymous responses
- Responses exported and analyzed with normalization

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What if a team member isn't contributing?**  
A: Document the issue, communicate with them first, then escalate to the instructor. Peer evaluations will reflect individual contributions.

**Q: How are different team roles weighted?**  
A: All roles (frontend, backend, DevOps) are equally valued. Evaluation is relative to your team's scope and complexity.

**Q: Can I contribute to multiple teams?**  
A: Yes! Cross-team contributions (helping with integration) are valued and will be captured in inter-team evaluations.

**Q: What if I'm sick and miss a sprint?**  
A: Notify the instructor immediately. Extensions can be granted with documentation. Your grade will be adjusted accordingly.

**Q: Are late commits counted?**  
A: Commits are tracked throughout the semester. Consistency matters more than last-minute bulk commits.
