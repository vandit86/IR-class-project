Why BeautifulSoup is not used? 

- For Angular/React/Vue apps, you need JavaScript execution, which BeautifulSoup cannot provide.

Current approach uses Selenium, which:

- Launches a real browser (Chrome)
- Executes JavaScript
- Waits for Angular to fetch and render data (WebDriverWait, time.sleep)
- Then extracts content from the fully-rendered DOM

Notice that code specifically waits for Angular components. 

Alternatives to Selenium (If you want lighter-weight solutions):

- Playwright - faster, more modern than Selenium
- API inspection - Angular apps often fetch data from JSON APIs you could call directly (check Network tab in DevTools)
- Puppeteer (Node.js) - similar to Selenium but lighter
